DockerCon is all about the users,
and on June 12-15th thousands of
Docker users, the entire Docker community
and ecosystem, will be taking over San Francisco
to learn, network and collaborate. From beginner
to expert, donâ€™t miss the opportunity to congregate with
the brightest minds and talk about all things containers,
container platform and management including networking,
storage, security, orchestration with Swarm and Kubernetes,
creating effective Docker images, machine learning, modernizing
applications and more.
